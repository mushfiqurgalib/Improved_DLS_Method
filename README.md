# Improved DLS Method Using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project presents an enhanced version of the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method for calculating target scores in rain-affected cricket matches. By utilizing linear regression techniques and data extracted from ESPN Cricinfo, we aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of the DLS method, ensuring fair outcomes in limited-overs cricket.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of historical match data to derive insights for improved target calculations.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Implementation of a linear regression model to predict target scores based on various match parameters.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations of data trends and model performance.
- **Enhanced DLS Method**: A revised version of the DLS method that incorporates findings from the linear regression analysis.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/improved-dls-method.git
   cd improved-dls-method
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Data Extraction
Data for this project was extracted from ESPN Cricinfo using web scraping techniques. The dataset includes detailed information on historical cricket matches, including:

Match outcomes
Innings scores
Overs played
Rain interruptions
Data Preparation
Instructions for data extraction and preprocessing are provided in the Jupyter notebook. The extraction process involves scraping match data and cleaning it for analysis.

## Usage
To use the notebook for calculating improved DLS scores, follow these steps:

Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run the notebook cells sequentially. The analysis is divided into sections, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and score prediction.

Example usage:

Input relevant match parameters such as overs remaining, wickets lost, and current score.
Execute the prediction cell to obtain the revised target score based on the improved DLS method.
## Results
The results section of the notebook includes:

A comparison of the traditional DLS method and the improved version.
Performance metrics for the linear regression model.
Visualizations showcasing the accuracy of predictions against actual match outcomes.
